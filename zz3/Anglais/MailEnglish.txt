Dear All,

Pleas find attached a reminder for your written and oral assignments.

Written:
Deadline Monday 27th February 18:00
Paper version in my pigeon hole
WARNING:
Marks will be deducted for lateness.

Oral:
I have made up an oral schedule.  Please look at it carefully and if there
is a major problem could the class representatives please send me an
email.
Changes to schedule:
If you need to change the date of your oral presentation please find
someone to swap (exchange) with and send me an email to inform me of the
change THIS WEEK.
WARNING:
If you do not turn up at the time indicated you will be awarded a ZERO
unless you have a medcial certificate.

TOEIC:
I sent the package off to Paris on FRiday so they should have received it
today.  They usually take 10 WORKING days to correct so in fact that means
that I should get the results just after Christmas.

For those of you who took the TOEIC for a second time please either give
me a cheque payable to "Université Blaise Pascal" for 46 euros or hand it
in to Corinne at Scolarité. I will not send you your score until I know
that you have paid your money...

Susan
